# Changelog

All notable changes to the OneSignal Dashboard Translator. The format is
loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) — see
[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for the bump rules.

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-30 — Beta release

First version handed off for beta testing with colleagues and partners.
Pre-1.0 development happened in a tight burst; this entry captures the
cumulative state at the beta cut.

### Languages

Seven supported languages, each at full coverage of **1,517 dictionary
entries + 73 regex patterns**:

- 🇯🇵 Japanese (`ja`)
- 🇪🇸 Spanish (`es`) — LATAM-neutral
- 🇧🇷 Portuguese (`pt`) — pt-BR
- 🇰🇷 Korean (`ko`)
- 🇫🇷 French (`fr`) — vous formal, infinitive buttons
- 🇹🇷 Turkish (`tr`) — siz formal, 2nd-person imperative buttons
- 🇨🇳 Simplified Chinese (`zh-CN`) — Mainland, drop-pronoun or 您 formal,
  bare-verb buttons

### Translation engine

- React-safe DOM translation: text-node walker, attribute allowlist,
  MutationObserver, curly-quote normalization, extension-context
  invalidation guard.
- Pattern-based translation for dynamic strings (date abbreviations,
  numeric counts, time-ago, "X selected" pluralization).
- Glossary substring enforcement so locked terms (Send / Manage / Delete /
  Audience / Segment / Journey / etc.) translate consistently across the
  dashboard.

### Feedback & ledger

- Right-click **"Suggest a better translation for ..."** context-menu
  entry, localized per active language. Opens a pre-filled Google Form
  with the highlighted text and current language already populated.
- Popup **"Report a translation issue"** button opens the same form
  pre-filled with the language only.
- Crowdsourced missed-string ledger: dashboard strings that didn't match
  the dictionary get queued in `chrome.storage.local`, batched daily, and
  POSTed to a Google Apps Script endpoint that lands rows in a Sheet.
  Opt-in by default (popup checkbox), with a "view what's queued" page.

### Popup chrome

- Localized popup UI: "Language" label, opt-in checkbox, queue link,
  feedback button, hint text, status messages, and the reload-confirm
  dialog all render in the active target language.
- Flag emojis next to each option in the language picker.
- OneSignal-branded extension icon (16/32/48/128, downscaled from a
  single 512×512 source PNG via Lanczos).

### Tooling

- `glossary.json` — 68 locked terms with per-language grammatical-variant
  alts and per-term `_skip_keys` for sources where the term appears in a
  different sense.
- `validate.py` — glossary substring check (case-insensitive on source),
  pattern regex compilability, capture-group reference check, ASCII
  straight-quote enforcement, untranslated informational count.
- `style/<lang>.md` — per-language addendum covering register, punctuation,
  length budgets, brand handling.
- `CLAUDE.md` — agent / contributor playbook, including the "always fill
  every supported language" rule and (added with this changelog) the
  versioning convention.
